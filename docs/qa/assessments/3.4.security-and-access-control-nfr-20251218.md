**Date:** 2025-12-18 **Assessor:** QA Agent

## Scope

## Assessment

### 1. Security

- **Requirement**: Authentication, Authorization (RBAC), Secure Headers.
- **Status**: **PASSED**
- **Evidence**:
  - JSON Web Tokens (JWT) used for stateless auth.
  - Role-Based Access Control (Streamer vs Viewer) implemented in middleware.
  - `helmet` used for secure headers (X-Content-Type-Options, etc.).
  - IDOR protection logic verified in tests.

### 2. Reliability

- **Requirement**: Consistent Auth state.
- **Status**: **PASSED**
- **Evidence**:
  - Middleware ensures 401/403 responses are consistent.
  - Cookie-based token delivery ensures client-side stability vs local storage issues.

## Recommendations

- **Audit**: Periodic audit of RBAC rules as new roles are added.
