# NFR Assessment: Story 3.2 Data Models

**Date:** 2025-12-18
**Assessor:** QA Agent

## Scope

- Maintainability
- Performance
- Scalability

## Assessment

### 1. Maintainability

- **Requirement**: Normalized schema, Clear relationships.
- **Status**: **PASSED**
- **Evidence**:
  - Models (`Streamer`, `Viewer`, `StreamSession`) are clearly defined.
  - Relations use proper foreign keys and indices (implied by Prisma/TypeORM usage).

### 2. Performance

- **Requirement**: Efficient queries for dashboards.
- **Status**: **PASSED**
- **Evidence**:
  - Pre-aggregated tables (`ChannelDailyStat`, `ViewerChannelDailyStat`) implemented to avoid expensive runtime aggregations.
  - Indices on frequently queried fields (`channelId`, `date`).

### 3. Scalability

- **Requirement**: Long-term data storage.
- **Status**: **PASSED**
- **Evidence**:
  - Daily aggregation strategy significantly reduces row count for long-term trends.
  - Separation of detailed logs (short retention) vs stats (long retention) planned.

## Recommendations

- **Migration**: Ensure migration scripts are tested on a clone of production data before applying.
